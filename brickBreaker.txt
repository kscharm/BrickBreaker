Welcome to Brick Breaker!

Controls: 
    Left mouse click (hold) - controls the paddle
    S (key press) - start the ball movement at the beginning of the game
    N (key press) - create a new game after losing a round
    E (key press) - exit the game
    
Instructions: 
    Use the paddle to deflect the ball and break the bricks. You are awarded
    points for breaking bricks and for using power-ups.
    Blue bricks - one hit (15 points)
    Red bricks - two hits (30 points)
    Green bricks - three hits (45 points)
    Power-ups give you a safety bar at the bottom of the screen (10 points)
      
Experience:
    When thinking of an approach to tackle Brick Breaker, I decided to 'break' it
    down into parts. I divided the game into three parts: the board, movement, and unit 
    collision. The first step in creating the game was drawing the board. Similar to Tetris, 
    the board consists of a 2d-array of colors, where black is the empty color. Movement 
    was also a important when creating the ball and power-ups. To allow movement, I 
    added a velocity to both the ball and power-ups. This worked out well because in order 
    to change direction, all I had to do was multiply the velocity by -1. Unit collision was by
    far the most difficult task of programming Brick Breaker. My implementation consists of 
    an xy coordinate system and the indices of the board array. To check to see if two objects 
    are close to each other, I found the center of each block and created a threshold value. If 
    the ball is within the threshold, the block is destroyed.
